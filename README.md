# :warning: Deprecation Notice

This project has been deprecated and archived. New issues won't be answered and PRs won't be merged. If you were using
this project we are recommending to switch directly to [kube-prometheus (jsonnet version)](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus#kube-prometheus)
or [kube-prometheus-stack (helm chart version)](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack)
and to use [opentelemetry helm charts](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-helm-charts) directly.

# tobs - The Observability Stack for Kubernetes

Tobs is a tool that aims to make it as easy as possible to install a full observability
stack into a Kubernetes cluster. Currently this stack includes:

<img src="docs/assets/tobs-arch.png" alt="Tobs Architecture Diagram" width="800"/>

* [Kube-Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus#kube-prometheus) the Kubernetes monitoring stack
  * [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) to collect metrics
  * [AlertManager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager#alertmanager-) to fire the alerts
  * [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) to visualize what's going on
  * [Node-Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) to export metrics from the nodes
  * [Kube-State-Metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics) to get metrics from kubernetes api-server
  * [Prometheus-Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator#prometheus-operator) to manage the life-cycle of Prometheus and AlertManager custom resource definitions (CRDs)
* [Promscale](https://github.com/timescale/promscale) ([design doc](https://tsdb.co/prom-design-doc)) to store metrics for the long-term and allow analysis with both PromQL and SQL.
* [TimescaleDB](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb) for long term storage of metrics and provides ability to query metrics data using SQL.
  * [Postgres-Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-community/postgres_exporter) to get metrics from PostgreSQL server
* [Opentelemetry-Operator](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator#opentelemetry-operator-for-kubernetes) to manage the lifecycle of OpenTelemetryCollector Custom Resource Definition (CRDs)

We plan to expand this stack over time and welcome contributions.

Tobs provides a helm chart to make deployment and operations easier. It can be used directly or as a sub-chart for other projects.

# Quick start

## Prerequisites

Using tobs to install full observability stack with openTelemetry support currently requires installation of cert-manager.
To do install it please follow [cert-manager documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/).

*Note*: cert-manager is not required when using tobs with opentelemetry support disabled.

## Installing the helm chart

The following command will install Kube-Prometheus, OpenTelemetry Operator, TimescaleDB, and Promscale
into your Kubernetes cluster:

```
helm repo add timescale https://charts.timescale.com/
helm repo update
helm install --wait <release_name> timescale/tobs
```

*Note*: `--wait` flag is necessary for successfull installation as tobs helm chart can create opentelemetry Custom Resources only after opentelemetry-operator is up and running. This flag can be omitted when using tobs without opentelemetry support.

For detailed configuration and usage instructions, take a look at the [helm chart's README](/chart/README.md).

# Configuring the stack

All configuration for all components happens through the helm values.yaml file.
You can view the self-documenting [default values.yaml](chart/values.yaml) in the repo.
We also have additional documentation about individual configuration settings in our
[Helm chart docs](chart/README.md#configuring-helm-chart).
